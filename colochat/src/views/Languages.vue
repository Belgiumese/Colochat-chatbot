        <br>
        <p>
          Before colonisation in the 1870s–1880s, the language was the major lingua franca of the area in both
          Australia and
          Papua New Guinea, and is still widely spoken by neighbouring Papuans and by some Aboriginal people. How many
          non-first
          language speakers it has is unknown. It also has a 'light' (simplified/foreigner) form, as well as a
          pidginised form.
          The simplified form is fairly prevalent on Badu and neighbouring Moa, particularly among younger people.

        <h3>Yuwaalaraay</h3>
        <p>
          Yuwaalaraay is the name of the Aboriginal language and Aboriginal people of the Balonne River Region –
          Yuwaalaraay is
          connected linguistically to Gamilaraay, the language of the Gamilaroi/Kamilaroi people. The language area
          extends
          across north west NSW on the Barwon River into south west Queensland along the Culgoa and Balonne Rivers.
          This area
          takes in the communities of Hebel, Dirranbandi and St George, extending south towards Goodooga, Walgett,
          Lightning
          Ridge and Collarenebri.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          There is a significant amount of documentation on the Yuwaalaraay language from first contact in the 1840s
          with several
          lexicons, wordlists and other vocabularies. Linguistic work by Rev William Ridley and recent linguists such
          as Austin,
          Lissarrague, Ash and Giacon means there is an accompanying grammar to provide clues on how the language was
          constructed
          and spoken. Fortunately, there have been ongoing language revival activities across the region to bring the
          language
          back to life in schools and communities. However, there is a concern that Yuwaalaraay language is not spoken
          on a daily
          basis as there are minimal fluent speakers.

        <h3>Yuwibara</h3>
        <p>
          Yuwibara is the name of the language of Aboriginal people of the Mackay region – often it is listed under the
          broad
          term of Yuri or Birri which refers to groups of related languages in North Queensland, extending from
          Marlborough to
          Townsville.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          As Aboriginal languages were oral-based, the spelling of Yuwibara and Yuwibara language may differ in
          historical
          documents and other sources; for example Yuwibara has also been spelt Juwibara, Yuipera, Yuwiburra and
          Yuibera. It was
          also referred to as Yuwi. There are also other language/dialect groups within the Mackay Region that may be
          related to
          Yuwibara.
